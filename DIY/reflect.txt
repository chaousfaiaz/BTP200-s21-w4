During this week i learnt about class and its instance object in C++. I was able to 
create and handle objects in C++. Workshop-3 mainly deals with class, with the help
of class i can can instantiate object. Object can have variables and function also
known as member functions. Class is a custom data type very similar to struct. Main
difference between class and struct is class's scope is by default private whereas
struct has public. For publicly scoped members we can access them from outside of 
class scope. publicly declared members are easily available to access than private
members. We can use publicly declared members to change the value of private
members. For e.g. i used  int calorie() const member function to return calorie.
we can access publicly declared members by DOT. In workshop Apart from this i learnt
about formatting with data input and output functions. i have used many ostream
functions to format proper output for this workshop. There are many useful
functions such as setf, fill, width and unsetf. I used setf and unsetf for alignment
means left alignment or fixed. I alos used fill to fill empty space with the desired
characters upto the size we decided for width. Width is also an ostream functions
which holds the width or spacing. last but not least unsetf is used to reset format.
precision functions is also there to determine the precision. I did not face any
major problem doing this workshop.
